## Newton method visualization in MatLab

A MatLab project focusing on the visualization of the convergence speed of Newton’s method (in the complex domain) applied to finding a zero of the polynomial:

$w_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k \bigl(T_k(x) + U_k(x)\bigr)$

It was developed as part of the *Numerical Methods* course at Warsaw University of Technology.
