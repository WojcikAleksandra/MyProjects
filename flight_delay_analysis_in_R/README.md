## Structured Data Processing Project - Flight delays analysis

This project focuses on the analysis of flight delays and their underlying causes, including the aircraft production year.

It was developed as part of the *Structured Data Processing (PDU)* academic course as a group project and includes data analysis and visualization implemented in R, with an interactive component built using Shiny.
